# vi:sw=2:expandtab

+ switch to string in lexer, as exec.Command also needs string
+ simple hand-crafted flag parser for -N/+N etc
- more meaningful error message from subprocess
+ show proper usage with subcommand
+ allow negative column numbers and make -1 (last column) a default
  + perfect for passdb case
  + requires column caching
+ strip CRLF from subprocess output

+ allow quoted text in columns
  the case is for example in-code doublequoted strings

+ allow unquoting of data

+ bug#1 [multiword data]: fixed
  solution: 
  selected column goes to subcmd as data with spaces inside,
  minus leading and trailing spaces

+ process bytes not string

+ turn into a lib (for single line) plus cmd

- think of flag for just extracting the column, possibly with unquote,
  and pass to yet extra command (pbcopy|xsel!)
