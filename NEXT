+ switch to string in lexer, as exec.Command also needs string
- more meaningful error message from subprocess
+ or simple hand-crafted flag parser for -N/+N etc
+ show proper usage with subcommand
+ allow negative column numbers and make -1 (last column) a default
  + perfect for passdb case
  + requires column caching
+ strip CRLF from subprocess output
- multi-character separator

- bug#1:
  selected column should go to subcmd as a whole, even with spaces, minus
  leading spaces
  ..use csv?
