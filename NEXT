- switch to string in lexer, as exec.Command also needs string
- more meaningful error message from subprocess
- maybe switch to other flags lib
- show proper usage with subcommand
- allow negative field numbers and make -1 (last column) a default
  - perfect for passdb case
  - requires column caching
